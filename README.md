# LookupNPI
Simple app to look up provider information from NPI using an API

This is a Meteor project - to run, you must have <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> installed. Once the project is cloned, at a command line navigate to the project directory then just type "meteor". Once running, the application can be accessed via a web browser at localhost:3000.
The first startup may take some time. Subsequest startups will be much faster.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of the <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help-api">CMS NPI API</a> and data elements in Meteor and javascript. A much better lookup tool can be found on the actual CMS site at https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/
